Please install pandas before running the dataorg script.

## to install pandas go to command promt and write " pip install pandas "

Run the 'dataorg.py' file using << python dataorg.py >> command on a terminal.

question 4:-

It is not a difficult assesment. I would rate it as 3 between 1 to 10 as I haven't used pandas module before this assesment.
it is a kind of interesting assesment I would love to do more assesments like this.
